# bioda
a biological data analysis service

# This service is a cloud service providing data analysis for biological and medical researchers. This service automates manual steps of DNA/Protein searches and result analysis.

# Features
# This service continually updates the DNA/Protein DNA sequence libraries, both public and authorized/private. It also supports realtime & batch searching. This service provides data and search result visualization. Lastly, this service supports collaboration- it includes data sharing, email, and online chat.


# Example Use Cases:
# User performs blast search against a human genome with large number of DNA/Protein sequence samples
# User finds a specific DNA pattern within existing genome
# User uses DNA profiling (fingerprinting) for forensic purposes and parentage testing, e.g. Short Tandem Repeats (STR) profiling
# User creates proprietary DNA sequence storage.

# This service may be extended to other applications, such as stock analysis
